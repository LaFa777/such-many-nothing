No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```

```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

```

### Testing

You have to do no TDD to do nothing:

```

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

```

I know right?

### Serverless

No code works best nowhere, however you can also run it somewhere.

```
$
```

This way you can do the nothing you did nowhere everywhere.

### Fault Tolerance 

Since there is nocode, that runs nowhere, we inherently have Fault tolerance. Have a look at the following: 

```

```

I know, this is revolutionary!

### Disaster recovery
When a catastrophic disaster event occurs, the system continues in its nocode norun policy. This can be implemented in all cloud and non-cloud platforms in existence and yet to be invented.

Here is an example nocode on Microsoft Azure. Same can be achieved on AWS Cloud.

```

```

Take a moment to absorb that.

### Deploy your own ERC20-Token on the Ethereum-Blockchain

Since you still have no code written for any ERC20-Token, all you have to do is this:
```

```

Dead simple, right?

## How It Works

No code was designed to be completely autonomus, secure and resilient. With an extreme advanced AI it runs on any cloud, heals itself, learns the patterns to optimise itself and even understands new features in advance. When it's needed it codes in itself too.
As such, intervention is not needed. The need for understanding how it works is null. It's completely free of any engagement, unlike any other code.
